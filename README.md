# PM CI/CD Demo

This repository is a lightweight demo of a basic CI/CD workflow for a containerized Python app.

## What This Demonstrates

- Basic Python service
- Docker containerization
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline triggered on push

## Why I Built This

As a Technical Product Manager, I believe it’s important to understand:

- How code moves from commit to execution
- How CI pipelines validate changes
- How containerization standardizes runtime environments

This project is intentionally simple and meant to reinforce hands-on familiarity with the workflow.
